- 👋 Hi, I’m @PigmentPrograms
- 👀 I’m interested in everything to do with indie gamedev from coding to music, or even the sound design! I love it all and can't wait to share what I make!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code on Godot, for a number of reasons (Including what Unity did)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not really much places, I just ask for help where I can
- 📫 How to reach me I have a discord :p
